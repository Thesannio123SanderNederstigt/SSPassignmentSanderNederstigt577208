# SSPassignmentSanderNederstigt577208
This is my Server Side Programming course assignment repository from a Cloud Computing 1 minor program.

SSP assignment API endpoints for an application where an image can be uploaded and edited with a retrieved color (from the color api) derived from the uploaded image and text based on that color from another public dictionary api.

PNG type images can be uploaded to the `uploadImage` endpoint. 

The status of the image while it is processing or when it is done being processed can be viewed from the `ImageStatus` endpoint and the url linking to the altered image can be retrieved from the `getImage` endpoint.

This is an Azure function C# API application (with openAPI swagger specification added).
